## Description

This is a README file created through my coding bootcamp course. My motivation is learning how to code so I can pursue a career in coding, although I am not exactly sure what field I want to be in yet. I build this project as practice through provided modules built around teaching those eager to learn how to code, this solves the problem of myself wanting to know more about how to code. So far through the modules I have learned some of the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
